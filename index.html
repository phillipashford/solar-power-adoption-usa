      <h1>Shining a Light on Residential Solar: 30 Years of Solar Energy in American Homes</h1>
      <h3>About this web map</h3>
      <p>This interactive map allows users to explore the varied adaption of solar power in the residential energy
        sector in the United States over time.</p>
      <p>Programatically dynamic color-coding helps to visualize the percentage of all of the residential electrical
        consumption which was derived from solar power.</p>
      <p>Immediately obvious patterns that may be apparent to users include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It seems there was earlier adoption, and it seems there are greater percentages of solar power usage, in southerly and
          sunnier locales.</li>
        <li>Hawaii is such an outlier (23% in 2020) that it is the only state in the top tier!</li>
        <li>There seems to be a more rapid uptick in the years after 2010.</li>
        <li>Seemingly all states have increased their relative solar energy usage in residential consumption during this
          three decade period.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>About the Data</h3>
      <p>
        The energy data visualized in this map was acquired from the <a
          href="https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/seds">API Dashboard</a> of the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/">US
          Energy Information Administration</a>.</p>
      <p>The EIA has succeeded in their mission to "[make] energy data more accessible, understandable, relevant, and
        responsive to your needs". Their data portal and API is a great model for other governmental groups with a
        commitment to open data.</p>
      <p>The EIA's user-friendly API is free to the public with no account registration required.
      </p>
      <p>
        The state polygons were created from shapefiles retrieved from <a
          href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>, an open repository offering free vector and raster
        map data in the public domain.
